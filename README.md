# OpenGOAL - The Precursor Orb Hunt
Play via the [opengoal-mod-launcher](https://github.com/OpenGOAL-Unofficial-Mods/opengoal-mod-launcher)!

It's Jak 1 but everything is moved all around! No custom levels and no new actors have been added in this mod - it's more-or-less the vanilla game except that existing actors have been relocated!


**All collectables needed for 100% should be "in bounds"**, meaning they should be plainly visible and accessible, in the sense that you should never need to pass through (what appear to be) solid walls/objects to get to them (though I can't stop you from doing that when possible)
- You may need to work around some invisible collision/walls
- You may  need to have knowledge of speedrunning tech, such as dealing with slippery surfaces, zoom-walking, extended uppercuts, boosted uppercuts, infinite jump ceilings, etc
- The Zoomer and Flutflut should only be necessary in their intended levels, however you CAN safely take them to any level without crashing (inb4 the optimal route is all Flutflut)

  
Some collectables are annoying to reach - you may want to ease your pain by using **Baby Mode** (Options > Game Options > Baby Mode)
- Hold L2 and press Dpad Down to store your current position (only works when Jak has a standpoint)
- Hold L2 and press Dpad Up to reset back to your previously stored position (this will also reset actors as if you had loaded a save file - green eco crates, enemies, etc)


There are a few stupid easter eggs as well, see if you can spot them! (hint: nice)
