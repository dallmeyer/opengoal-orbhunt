## Concept
It's Jak 1 but everything is moved all around! All the level models and collision are unchanged, and no new actors have been added in this mod - it's more-or-less the vanilla game except that existing actors have been relocated!

Mid-2022 I was watching [headstrong1290](https://www.twitch.tv/headstrong1290) running Jak II Any% All Orbs, and [Xyphles](https://www.twitch.tv/xyphles) running Jak 3 All Open Orbs, and I thought - "Hey, what if the Orbs in Jak 1 were tucked away like in these games? That could be fun..." Well very quickly that morphed into moving ALL the things around, but I did stick with the name "Orb Hunt" as a shoutout to the original inspiration :)

## Collectables
**All collectables needed for 100% should be "in bounds"** meaning they should be plainly visible and accessible:
- Clipping through (what appear to be) solid walls/objects should never be necessary (though I can't stop you from doing it when possible)
- You might need to use your goggles in first-person mode to spot some collectables
- Collectables should be within the normal boundaries of their respective levels (e.g. no Citadel orbs in Final Boss area)
- Taking a death should never be necessary (good luck with deathless), though a couple collectables might require Save+Load
- It shouldn't be possible to softlock yourself out of any collectables (though you might need to Save+Load to reset things like eco crates)
- You will need to work around some invisible collision/walls
- You will need knowledge of speedrunning tech, such as dealing with slippery surfaces, zoom-walking, extended uppercuts, boosted uppercuts, infinite jump ceilings, rocket uppercuts, Flutflut wall climbing, etc
  - Some of the harder/inconsistent tricks such as 1-frames, 3-frame jumps, and eco rockets are NOT required, though you might find uses for them.
- The Zoomer and Flutflut should only be necessary in their intended levels, however you CAN safely take them to any level without crashing (inb4 the optimal route is all Flutflut). The invisible walls that are associated with the Zoomer and Flutflut are also removed.
- When completing tasks (e.g. Free 7 Scout Flies), Power Cells will often fly off and spawn further away than typical in the vanilla game

## Difficulty Toggles (previously known as Baby Mode)
Some collectables are well-hidden and/or annoying to reach - you may want to ease your pain by using some of the below options to change the difficulty (you can find them under Options > Game Options)
- UNLOCKED WARP GATES - all warp gates are unlocked from the very beginning, so you're not trapped in Geyser Rock
- PSEUDO SAVESTATES - set custom checkpoints that you can quickly reset to! These only work when Jak has a standpoint - you'll hear a ding to confirm/buzz if rejected
  - Hold R3 and press Dpad Down to store your current position
  - Hold R3 and press Dpad Up to reset back to your previously stored position
    - Note: this will also reset actors (green eco crates, enemies, etc), similar to dying or loading a save file
  - Note: if you reboot into _debug mode_, use L2 instead of R3. Also be sure "Game" is highlighted in the menu that comes up when you hold L3 and press R3
- CLOSEST ORB - color-coded text displays the distance from Jak to the closest nearby Precursor Orb (including orbs within crates/vents/Plant Boss)

## Bonus
- A special reward awaits you if you collect all 2000 orbs - go check out a warp gate!
- There are a few stupid easter eggs as well, see if you can spot them! (hint: nice)

Orb Hunt II soon™️
