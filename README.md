## Concept
It's Jak 1 but everything is moved all around! All the level models and collision are unchanged, and no new actors have been added in this mod - it's more-or-less the vanilla game except that existing actors have been relocated!

Mid-2022 I was watching [headstrong1290](https://www.twitch.tv/headstrong1290) running Jak II Any% All Orbs, and [Xyphles](https://www.twitch.tv/xyphles) running Jak 3 All Open Orbs, and I thought - "Hey, what if the Orbs in Jak 1 were tucked away like in these games? That could be fun..." Well very quickly that morphed into moving ALL the things around, but I did stick with the name "Orb Hunt" as a shoutout to the original inspiration :)

## Collectables
**All collectables needed for 100% should be "in bounds"** meaning they should be plainly visible and accessible:
- Clipping through (what appear to be) solid walls/objects should never be necessary (though I can't stop you from doing it when possible)
- You might need to use your goggles in first-person mode to spot some collectables
- Collectables should be within the normal boundaries of their respective levels (e.g. no Citadel orbs in Final Boss area)
- Taking a death should never be necessary (good luck with deathless), though a couple collectables might require Save+Load
- It shouldn't be possible to softlock yourself out of any collectables (though you might need to Save+Load to reset things like eco crates)
- You will need to work around some invisible collision/walls
- You will need knowledge of speedrunning tech, such as dealing with slippery surfaces, zoom-walking, extended uppercuts, boosted uppercuts, infinite jump ceilings, rocket uppercuts, Flutflut wall climbing, etc
  - Some of the harder/inconsistent tricks such as 1-frames, 3-frame jumps, and eco rockets are NOT required, though you might find uses for them.
- The Zoomer and Flutflut should only be necessary in their intended levels, however you CAN safely take them to any level without crashing (inb4 the optimal route is all Flutflut)
- When completing tasks (e.g. Free 7 Scout Flies), Power Cells will often fly off and spawn further away than typical in the vanilla game

## Baby Mode  
Some collectables are annoying to reach - you may want to ease your pain by using **Baby Mode** (Options > Game Options > Baby Mode)
- Hold L2 and press Dpad Down to store your current position (only works when Jak has a standpoint - you'll hear a ding to confirm)
- Hold L2 and press Dpad Up to reset back to your previously stored position (this will also reset actors as if you had loaded a save file - green eco crates, enemies, etc)
- Note: if you reboot in debug mode, Baby Mode will only work if "Game" is highlighted in the menu that comes up when you hold L3 and press R3

## Bonus
- A special reward awaits you if you collect all 2000 orbs - go check out a warp gate!
- There are a few stupid easter eggs as well, see if you can spot them! (hint: nice)
