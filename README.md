It's Jak 1 but everything is moved all around! No custom levels and no new actors have been added in this mod - it's more-or-less the vanilla game except that existing actors have been relocated!


**All collectables needed for 100% should be "in bounds"** meaning they should be plainly visible and accessible:
- Passing through (what appear to be) solid walls/objects should never be necessary (though I can't stop you from doing it when possible)
- Taking a death should never be necessary (but good luck with that)
- You may need to work around some invisible collision/walls
- You will need knowledge of speedrunning tech, such as dealing with slippery surfaces, zoom-walking, extended uppercuts, boosted uppercuts, infinite jump ceilings, etc
- The Zoomer and Flutflut should only be necessary in their intended levels, however you CAN safely take them to any level without crashing (inb4 the optimal route is all Flutflut)
- When completing tasks, Power Cells may sometimes spawn further away than typical in the vanilla game

  
Some collectables are annoying to reach - you may want to ease your pain by using **Baby Mode** (Options > Game Options > Baby Mode)
- Hold L2 and press Dpad Down to store your current position (only works when Jak has a standpoint - you'll hear a ding to confirm)
- Hold L2 and press Dpad Up to reset back to your previously stored position (this will also reset actors as if you had loaded a save file - green eco crates, enemies, etc)


There are a few stupid easter eggs as well, see if you can spot them! (hint: nice)
